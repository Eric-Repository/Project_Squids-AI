# Squids-AI-Project
A project started when I was an undergrad at York University. This project was created together with Martin Harriott, and Yodhin Singh.

This project simulates "fish" and "squid" AI within a constrained simulated environment.

The "fish" serve as the "food" and have a fixed size with varying colours.
The "squid" serve as the "predators" having varying sizes and colours.
"Fish" will avoid the "squid".
"Squid" will chase down the "fish".

More vibrant colours are easier for both "fish" and "squids" to see.
Vibrant colour "fish" allow them to "school" more easily with other "fish".
Vibrant colour "squid" are easier for "fish" to see and avoid.
However, the more vibrant the colour the shorter the lifespan of the "fish"/"squid"

Squid also have one additional trait other than colour.
Size, larger squid have larger bodies making it easier to collide/"catch" fish. However, larger bodies move slower.

Within this project there also exists "coral". The coral's sole purpose is to create and force interactions (fish to fish, squid to fish, and squid to squid).

There are trade offs in quantitative traits the the "fish" and "squid" have. This project aims to simulate evolution to see what traits will become more dominant within the "simulated ecosystem" that is this project.
